# Template for a Full Stack Application

This repo is a template for building a full stack application utilizing a HTML/JavaScript frontend and a `json-server` for the backend. The HTML file is already linked to a CSS page as well as a JavaScript file; all that's left to do is to alter the `db.json` file, so that it contains some information for you to manipulate on the DOM.

Once you have changed the `db.json` file, fire up the server by running the following:
`json-server --watch db.json`

Use your understanding of Fetch, Event Listeners and DOM manipulation to make a fully-functioning CRUD application. In order to do this, you may have to add more HTML elements on the `index.html` file, but make sure that you're not hard-coding any specific information. All the specifics of your application should be coming from your backend!
